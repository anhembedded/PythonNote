### Other Numeric Types in Python

Python provides additional numeric types beyond integers, floats, and complex numbers, including **Decimal** and **Fraction** types, which help improve numerical accuracy.

#### **Decimal Type**

* Introduced in Python 2.4, Decimals are fixed-precision floating-point numbers.
* Created using `Decimal` from the `decimal` module, typically initialized with strings for accuracy.
* Example:
  ```python
  from decimal import Decimal
  Decimal('0.1') + Decimal('0.1') + Decimal('0.1') - Decimal('0.3')  # Output: Decimal('0.0')
  ```
* Avoids floating-point precision errors (e.g., `0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 - 0.3` results in `5.55e-17` with floats).
* Global precision can be set using `decimal.getcontext().prec = n`.
* The `with` statement allows temporary precision changes using `decimal.localcontext()`.

#### **Fraction Type**

* Introduced in Python 2.6 and 3.0, `Fraction` represents rational numbers using a numerator and denominator.
* Automatically simplifies fractions using the greatest common divisor (GCD).
* Example:
  ```python
  from fractions import Fraction
  x = Fraction(1, 3)  
  y = Fraction(4, 6)  # Simplified to Fraction(2, 3)
  ```
* Fractions avoid floating-point inaccuracies, providing exact arithmetic operations.
* Can be initialized from strings or floats (`Fraction.from_float(1.75)`).
* Mixed-type arithmetic is supported but may require explicit conversions.

#### **Key Differences**

| Feature   | Float          | Decimal                | Fraction                  |
| --------- | -------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Precision | Limited        | Configurable           | Exact                     |
| Storage   | Hardware-based | Arbitrary precision    | Numerator/denominator     |
| Speed     | Fastest        | Slower                 | Slowest                   |
| Use Case  | General math   | Financial calculations | Exact rational arithmetic |

Both Decimal and Fraction improve numerical accuracy at the cost of performance.

### **"Numeric Extensions"**

Python has powerful built-in numeric types, but third-party libraries extend its capabilities for specialized needs. **NumPy (Numeric Python)** is a widely used extension that provides advanced numerical tools such as matrices, vector processing, and high-performance computations. It is popular in scientific fields, including NASA and Los Alamos, as an alternative to languages like C++, FORTRAN, and Matlab. NumPy, combined with Python, offers flexibility and performance comparable to Matlab. Other numerical tools, such as SciPy, statistics libraries, and plotting tools, are available through Pythonâ€™s package ecosystem. However,  **NumPy is not included with Python by default and must be installed separately** .
